# Solidity NFT practice

This repository contains a small collection of different NFT types, deploy scripts and tests.

* Random Ipfs NFT is one of three random images that will be generated at the time of creation. IPFS is also used to host the images.
* Dynamic Svg NFT is going to be hosted on chain and it will change based on the price of Ethereum.
